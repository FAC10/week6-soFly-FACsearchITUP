## Basic User Story

Our user will be able to search/select and access useful and interesting facts about each member of FAC 10.

## Designing our Interface

## User Journey

The user will be able to see all FAC members' names and photos by default.

They can filter through the members using a drop-down list at the top, e.g. find all users in a certain team.

They can then click on a person which will take them to that person's profile page.

## Tables in our Database

Our database will be a "[Read profile](http://help.boomi.com/atomsphere/GUID-B15E86E2-A76A-435E-A3F5-F810075192F8.html)" database, i.e. it takes an input from the user in the DOM (e.g. What languages does Person X speak?), and this is used to extract relevant information from the database.

See our database.md(ADD URL) to see all of our tables clearly displayed.
